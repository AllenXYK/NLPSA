The worst bit of The Razor's Edge is aggrandized in this film out of proportion. A further note on the second-rated-ness of the subject matter: 关于如何respond to evilness的解答，Maugham无疑提供了一个相当自私及肤浅的答案(if through Larry he attempted at providing an answer at all). 对于Sophie的拯救，Maugham明显let Larry off the hook way too easily by orchestrating her convenient disappearance (through obvious collusion with Isabel). I suspect Maugham has not an answer himself, or even didn't really pressed for an answer but only feigned to do so, which leaves a reader infinitely unsatisfied despite his keen observations. 书和电影里，唯一鲜活可爱值得sympathy的人只有Elliot和Suzanne.
