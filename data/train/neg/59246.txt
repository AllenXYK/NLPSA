The only episode of the Japanese Slam Dunk animation I have watch in childhood. Father bought this VCD together with Little Mermaid and another one in a ordinary bookstore. I have watched them for many times before I learn to play basketball properly in Changchun No. 5 High School's basketball class. Also watching NBA made me realised how absurd it is to dramatise basketball game in each points made in the court and forget the big picture of strategies and the importance of the last quarter when a lot of teams often turn the game over and win it.
