MsChrissybeast‘s comment：“If you want to know what Iceland's like without going there (although you should DEFINITELY go there), just listen to Sigur Ros or Jonsi. The mystic, magic, and bit of kookiness in their music perfectly captures Iceland. Every time I want to go back (all of the time) I just listen to either. I'm immediately transported back. (ill admit this makes my life a little more emotional than it needs to be and i tear up often, but i love it).”
