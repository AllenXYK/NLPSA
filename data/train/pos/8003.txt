"And all we represent is a q-tip's missed opportunity and a challenge to botox hahahhh Its not my fault they treat me like an oracle and that's what oracles do - they repeat themselves! Hahahaa What I fear is that on judgment day ones punishment will be to hear God reciting by heart the poems I wouldve written had my life been good."
