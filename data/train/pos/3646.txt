Akerman brings to world cinema a level of sensitivity & perception that surpasses the best of men (Rohmer, Bergman, Antonioni, Bresson). Les Rendez-vous d'Anna is at once warm and detached, familiar yet strange, funny but serious. It's a film where the personal intersects with the historical; the sexual with the political; and the particular with the universal. Ackerman dissects, deconstructs, and redefines the elements of cinema that JLG never managed to do.
