「What does it feel like when you're dancing? → ?I can't really explain it. I haven't got the words. It's a feeling that you can't control. I suppose it's like forgetting. Losing who you are. And at the same time something makes you whole. It's like that there's a music playing in your ear. And I'm listening and I'm listening and then I disappear. And then I feel a change like a fire deep inside. Something bursting me wide open. Impossible to hide. And suddenly I'm flying. Flying like a bird. Like electricity, electricity. Sparks inside of me and I'm free. I'm free.?」【Music by Elton John】
