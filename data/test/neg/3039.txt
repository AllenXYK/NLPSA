The title "Train to Hell" put a lot of pressure on me, but Hugh Grant's in it, for which I enjoyed it...until I lost patience. Thankfully it's not truly a terror film, and Hugh's even cuter for his fear of dogs. Also I discovered a somewhat amusing fact. When sex occurs, it's undoubtedly all about sex. But when Hugh Grant's in a sex scene, it's all about Hugh Grant. (Still, four times is too many...)
在一部并非因慢镜头漫长的电影里，休一如既往地优美。
